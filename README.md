Learning from Longitudinal Data in Electronic Health Record and Genetic Data to Improve Cardiovascular Event Prediction


The project explores several machine learning and deep learning models on features extracted from EHR for Cardiovascular disease prediction.

Models include:
* logistic regression, 
* random forests, 
* recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units.
